# js-regexp
ECMAScript RegExp object implemented in JavaScript.

This is my personal copy of the research internship project I did in the summer of 2011, where I contributed to the Tachyon javascript virtual machine that can be found at https://github.com/Tachyon-Team.

This code is also used, along with some fixes and modifications, at https://github.com/higgsjs/Higgs.
